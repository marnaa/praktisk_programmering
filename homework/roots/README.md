The answer for the root finding methods. 
The routine is found in main and draws upon routines developed previously
(ODE and gram-schmidt). The minimum of the Rosenbock function is found in out.RosenbockAndE.txt. 
Also here, we find the minimum energy, ground state, of the hydrogen function as 
was one of the goals in b). 
The calculated and exact state is found in psi0Plot.png. 
The how well both boundary conditions converge is illustrated in convBoundPlot.png (improved
boundary conditions), and convPlot.png (Not improved boundary conditions).
