The answer for the rootfinding methods. 
The roputine is found in main and draws upon routines developed previously,
(ODE and gram-schmidt). The minimum of the Rosenbock function is found in out.RosenbockAndE.txt. Also here, we find the
minimum energy, ground state, of the hydrogen function as was one of the goals
in b). The calculated and exact state is found in psi0Plot.png. 
The how well both boundary conditions converge is illustrated in convBoundPlot.png (improved), 
and convPlot.png (Not improved).
