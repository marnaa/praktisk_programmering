Again, all the functions are found in main.c, this is not optimal since here the functions are quite large,
but this is how it is. For part a) we solve y''=-y to test the routine works, this is illustrated in 
harmOscillator.png, where one also sees that the routine saves the path i.e. the plot is through one run of 
the ode-routine not the an iteration over x. 
Plots of solved SIR-ODEs with different parameters are found in the SIR plot and a plot of the 
number of infected as a function of time is found in SIRcompare.png. 
For part c) the calculated paths of the three body system is found in threebody.png.
