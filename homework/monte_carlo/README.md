out.data.txt contains integrals of the required in b) and of the normal distribution, to see if it give the right fraction.
The compareErrorPlot.png and the compareValuePlot.png
, compares the value of the integal (x^2+y^2)<1 => 1 else 0 through
the random value and the quasi random. For the error we would like to see
the error of the rand to decrase as N^(-1/2) and quasi as N^(-1)
