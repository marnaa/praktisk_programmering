The necessary test for part a) are found in out.diagtest.txt. For the infinite well.
the calculated energies are found in out.infWellEn.txt. And the 3 states with the lowest energy, 
calculated and exact, are plotted in infWellplot.png.
For the part c) the optimised jacobi routine is implemented, as all the other functions, this is also 
found in main.c, because I figured it easier for coding, not for reading. The optimized routine is tested
in time against the unoptimised and the gsl routine. This test is illustrated in timeplot.png
