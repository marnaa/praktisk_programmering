# praktisk_programmering
Homeworks in the course ppnm. For the most part the language is english, but since I have not agreed with myself 
from week to week, some danish might occur. For the most part the functions are all in main. I know this is not 
best practice, but I found it easier in the coding process. In the exam project, however, the functions are found in 
separate files.
